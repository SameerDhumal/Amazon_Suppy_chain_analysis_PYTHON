Case Study Related to Supply Chain & Inventory Management

**Objective**:
Utilize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling algorithms in Python to analyze a dataset of supply chains used by Amazon. The project aims to extract meaningful insights and address various business questions using two datasets: Sales Shipment Data and Inventory Stock Data.

**DATA :**
1) Inventory Stock data

2) Sales Shipment data

** Description:**

a. Data Exploration : (15%)

Explore data dimensions: number of rows and columns.
Identify numerical and categorical columns.
Note any data cleaning or preparation requirements.
Conduct detailed univariate and bivariate analysis for each variable.

b. Data Preparation: (15%)

Create a new flag variable for late delivery risk.
Rename variables following Python naming conventions.
Convert variable data types as per data descriptions.
Impute missing values with mean for numerical variables and mode for categorical variables.
Perform any other necessary data preparation steps.

c. List of Analysis : (40%)

Calculate high-level metrics such as total sale value, total sale units, inventory value, etc.
Analyze order status and delivery status.
Assess late delivery risk over time.
Explore order item quantity trends over time.
Analyze sales units, profit orders, order count by time intervals.
Investigate inventory units and value by class or cluster.
Analyze product order quantity trends over time.
Identify top products, categories, and cities in terms of revenue and sale units.
Assess payment methods by product category.
Evaluate shipping mode efficiency.
Analyze profitability and discount rates by category.
Conduct additional analysis as needed.

d. Visualization : (15%)

Create visualizations of the analysis, including sample reports and metrics provided as reference.
Generate additional visualizations beyond the provided sample reports and metrics.

e. Predictive Modeling : (20%)

Build a predictive model to forecast sales, aggregating data at the customer level.
Prepare end-to-end code with proper comments.
Derive insights from the predictive models
